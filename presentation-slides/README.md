The presentation slides added provide a visual representation of the information discussed during the presentation. They are designed to supplement the verbal content and provide a clear and organized layout of the key points, data, and examples. These `500+` slides includes images, screenshots and other visual aids to help convey the message and engage the audience. They are intended to be a useful tool for the presenter and audience to follow along and understand the material being presented.
